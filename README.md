# sleuth-webmvc-example
Example using Spring Cloud Sleuth to trace RPCs from Spring Web MVC

# Running the example
This example has two services: frontend and backend. They both report trace data to zipkin. To setup the demo, you need to start Frontend, Backend and Zipkin.

Once the services are started, open http://localhost:8080/
* This will call the backend (http://localhost:9000/api) and show the result, which defaults to a formatted date.

Next, you can view traces that went through the backend via http://localhost:9411/?serviceName=backend
* This is a locally run zipkin service which keeps traces in memory

# Starting the Services
Open this project in IntelliJ and run [sleuth.webmvc.Frontend](/src/main/java/sleuth/webmvc/Frontend.java) and [sleuth.webmvc.Backend](/src/main/java/sleuth/webmvc/Backend.java)

Next, run [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/), which stores and queries traces reported by the above services.

```bash
wget -O zipkin.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.zipkin.java&a=zipkin-server&v=LATEST&c=exec'
java -jar zipkin.jar
```
